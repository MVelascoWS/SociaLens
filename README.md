Project SociaLens

SociaLens is an immersive VR social app in which people can share, discover, experience and collect any NFT contents to their own wallet.

SociaLens is a social app where all users can share any content as an NFT and make them available to collect for free or purchasable.  This will give power to all 3D creators to showcase their work, and for VR users to see the full 3D work within VR. Not only does SociaLens work as a social media app on VR, but it also functions as a Social Commerce app within VR.
